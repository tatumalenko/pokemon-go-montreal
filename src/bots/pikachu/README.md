## Notes:

* **TO-DO**: (`guildMemberAdd.js` & `guildMemberRemove.js`)
    - [ ] Test scenarios!

* **TO-DO**: (`User.js`)
    - [x] Find way to make a validator function for each test in order to output error message for each when they fail

* **TO-DO** (`want.run`)
    - [x] Duplicate db entries
    - [ ] If one entry with same `name`, `iv`, and `level` exists but does not contain one or all of same `neighbourhoods` content, append it to existing `neighbourhoods` array in db
    - [x] Use of `location` or `locations` as neighbourhood sets the query to his current settings (if any)

* **TO-DO**: (`want.parseWildPreferenceQueryFromArgs`)
    - [x] Bad entries (out of range for `iv` and `level`)
    - [x] Bad entries (omitted for `iv` and `level`)

* **TO-DO**: (`unwant.run`)
    - [x] Remove entry with identical object query
    - [ ] If one entry with same `name`, `iv`, and `level` exists but differs in `neighbourhoods` content, overwrite field with the difference between the old and new one to existing `neighbourhoods` array in db
